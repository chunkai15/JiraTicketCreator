- Added proper validation for Slack webhook URL format
- Integrated saving/loading of Slack webhook URL with existing configuration system
- Added helpful instructions for obtaining Slack webhook URL
- Configuration is now saved when clicking "Save Configuration" button

    { 
      pattern: /^https:\/\/hooks\.slack\.com\//,
      message: 'Please enter a valid Slack webhook URL'
    }
  ]}
>
  <Input 
    placeholder="https://hooks.slack.com/services/..."
    prefix={<SlackOutlined />}
  />
</Form.Item>
```

**Changes**:

**Auto-Send Logic**:
```javascript

  const webhookUrl = SlackService.getWebhookUrl();
  if (!webhookUrl) {
    console.log('No Slack webhook URL configured, skipping notification');
    return;
  }
  
  const result = await SlackService.sendReleaseNotification(webhookUrl, releaseData);
  // Handle success/error messaging
};
```

### 3. ✅ Updated Message Format
**Location**: `/src/services/slackService.js`

**New Format**:
```
:rocket: API 3.72.3
• API 3.72.3 Release - Oct 1, 2025 (Main Page)
• Release checklist for the API 3.72.3 (Checklist)
```

**Changes**:
- Removed "Hi team, đây là release checklist on [date]" header
- Added `:rocket:` emoji icon before release name
- Simplified format to show release name with icon, followed by page links
- Each page link shows title and type (Main Page/Checklist)
- Uses short URLs when available for cleaner appearance

### 4. ✅ Removed Slack Notification Card
**Location**: `/src/components/release/ReleasePageCreator.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed `SlackConfigCard` component from release creator page
- Removed manual "Send to Slack" functionality
- Removed message preview functionality
- Streamlined UI to focus on page creation

## User Experience Flow

### Before Changes:
1. User creates release pages
2. Manual Slack configuration card appears
3. User must manually configure webhook URL
4. User must manually click "Send to Slack"
5. User sees message preview before sending

### After Changes:
1. User configures Slack webhook URL in Settings page (one-time setup)
2. User creates release pages
3. **Automatic** Slack notification is sent immediately after successful creation
4. User sees success/error message for Slack notification
5. No manual intervention required for subsequent releases

## Configuration Setup

### For Users:
1. **One-time Setup**:
   - Go to Settings page
   - Add Slack webhook URL in the configuration form
   - Click "Save Configuration"

2. **Get Slack Webhook URL**:
   - Go to Slack workspace settings
   - Navigate to Apps → Incoming Webhooks
   - Click "Add to Slack" and choose channel
   - Copy webhook URL

3. **Usage**:
   - Create release pages as usual
   - Slack notification automatically sent after successful creation
   - No additional steps required

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `src/components/release/ConfigurationCard.js` - Added Slack configuration
- `src/services/slackService.js` - Updated message format
- `src/components/release/ReleasePageCreator.js` - Added auto-send functionality
- `server/server.js` - (Previous changes) Slack webhook endpoint

### Files Removed/Unused:
- `src/components/release/SlackConfigCard.js` - No longer used in release creator

### Configuration Storage:
- Slack webhook URL stored in localStorage via `SlackService.saveWebhookUrl()`
- Integrated with existing configuration save/load system
- Persists across browser sessions

## Error Handling

### Scenarios Covered:
1. **No webhook URL configured**: Silent skip with console log
2. **Invalid webhook URL**: Validation error in settings form
3. **Slack API failure**: Warning message to user, doesn't block page creation
4. **Network issues**: Proper error handling with user feedback

### User Feedback:
- Success: "✅ Slack notification sent successfully!"
- Warning: "⚠️ Failed to send Slack notification: [error details]"
- Info: "Sending Slack notification..." (during process)

## Benefits

### Improved Workflow:
- ✅ One-time setup instead of per-release configuration
